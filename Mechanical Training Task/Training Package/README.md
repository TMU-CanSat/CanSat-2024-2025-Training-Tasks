Use the above video as a reference for your assembly. (There is no need for screws for the joints. Just ensure that the parts do not intersect.)

**Expectations:**
- Ability to use the Standard and Advanced Mating tool.
- Ability to use the Rotation and Move Component tool.
- Assembly is **fully functional**.

# PART 2: MODELLING
Create a camera gimbal+mount for a drone and make an assembly using the provided parts and your own parts.
Use the models for gear motor and camera in "Part 2: Modelling" to guide your creation!

Use this picture as inspiration for your gimbal!

**Expectations:**
- Ability to create sketches using a variety of lines.
- Ability to use the extrude, hole cut, and fillet tools.
- Proper dimensioning in millimeters.
- Functionality of the design.
- Attention to detail.
- Creativity.
- Assembly and parts created are **fully functional**.

# BONUS: Finding Essential Hardware
**Use the McMaster-Carr Website to search. (https://www.mcmaster.com/)**
For your camera gimbal in "PART 2", find a screw that would be most ideal to hold the camera in your designed camera mount. 
Next, use the website to find the CAD file, and upload it into your assembly. (It does not have to be Mated into the slot. Just have it visible outside.)

**Expectations:**
- Diameter of screw is correct.
- Screw CAD file has been correctly uploaded into assembly.
- Other characteristics of the screw align with the mount design.
